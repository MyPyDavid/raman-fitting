git flow release start x.y.z

# Ensure all tests are passing
# or use CI provider to run them automatically
pytest --cov --cov-report xml:coverage.xml

# Run bumpversion to change any version strings
# scattered throughout the source code
bumpversion major/minor/patch
# !!! Check if pre-commit hooks are enabled
# bump2version may fail the commit if pre-commit hooks fail...
# bump2version patch --no-commit
